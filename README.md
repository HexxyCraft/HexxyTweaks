# HexxyTweaks

Fabric mod providing tweaks for the HexxyCraft modpack.

## Tweaks

* Adds the placement helper from metal ladders to vanilla ladders, and makes vanilla ladders wrenchable.
* Disables command signs (the `run_command` click event).
* Reverts Create 0.5.1's per-player deployers to prevent true name shenanigans.
