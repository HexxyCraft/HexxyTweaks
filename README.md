# HexxyTweaks

Fabric mod providing tweaks for the HexxyCraft modpack.

## Tweaks

* Adds the placement helper from metal ladders to vanilla ladders, and makes vanilla ladders wrenchable.
* Disables command signs (the `run_command` click event), with the following fun additions:
  * Breaks the sign on use.
  * Kills the player who tried to use the sign with Hex's Shame On You mishap.
  * If a deployer tries to use the sign, breaks the deployer and kills its owner.
* Reverts Create 0.5.1's per-player deployers to prevent true name shenanigans.
